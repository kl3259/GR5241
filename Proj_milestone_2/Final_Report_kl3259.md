### **Part 4: Deep Learning**

<br>

#### **Task 1: Getting Started (10 Points)**

<br>

**3.** (5 points) Train a single layer neural network with 100 hidden units (e.g. with architecture: 784 → 100 → 10). You should use the initialization scheme discussed in class and choose a reasonable learning rate (i.e. 0.1). Train the network repeatedly (more than 5 times) using different random seeds, so that each time, you start with a slightly different initialization of the weights. Run the optimization for at least 150 epochs each time. If you observe underfitting, continue training the network for more epochs until you start seeing overfitting.
